;; Two-runtime gate: the same .cljc suite under nbb (ClojureScript on Node),
;; not just the JVM.
;;
;; This is not redundancy. The JVM and ClojureScript disagree about things
;; that pure-looking code walks straight into — integer vs double arithmetic,
;; and the order in which a map literal's value forms are evaluated once the
;; map is large enough to become a hash-map. A suite that only ever runs on
;; one of them is green for a reason unrelated to whether the code is
;; correct. (`90-docs/adr/2607300500` records two such traps found exactly
;; this way, in a codec plane whose nbb run was fully green while seven JVM
;; tests errored.)
;;
;; Run:
;;   nbb --classpath "src:test:../webrtc/src:../org-w3-webrtc-signaling/src:\
;;   ../org-ietf-turn/src:../bytes/src" run-tests.cljs
;;
;; The classpath is passed rather than baked in because nbb resolves
;; :local/root deps.edn entries differently from the JVM; naming the sibling
;; source dirs explicitly is the same multi-dir --classpath pattern
;; kototama/web/generate.cljs and the design-quality sample generator use.
