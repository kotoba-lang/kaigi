;; Run a real TURN relay for the relay-path end-to-end test.
;;
;; `kotoba.turn.listener` (kotoba-lang/org-ietf-turn) is an actual RFC 8656
;; relay on a `node:dgram` socket — not a mock. Pointing kaigi at it and forcing
;; `iceTransportPolicy: "relay"` in the browser is the only way to prove the
;; relay path carries media: with both browsers on one machine, an unforced call
;; connects over host candidates and a completely broken TURN configuration
;; still passes every other test.
;;
;; The shared secret is taken from TURN_SECRET so the same value can be handed
;; to the Worker, which mints per-participant credentials against it
;; (`kaigi.turn`). A default is used when unset because this is a test relay
;; bound to localhost; a deployed relay must be given a real secret.
;;
;; Run:
;;   TURN_SECRET=test-secret nbb turn-server.cljs
;;
;; Requires the org-ietf-turn + bytes sources on the classpath:
;;   nbb --classpath "../../org-ietf-turn/src:../../bytes/src" turn-server.cljs
