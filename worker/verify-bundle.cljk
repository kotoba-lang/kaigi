;; Verify the built Worker bundle by actually loading it.
;;
;; This exists because the cheap checks lie. `shadow-cljs compile` exits 0 and
;; emits every expected export name; `node --check` validates syntax; neither
;; notices that a dev-mode artifact imports a machine-local
;; `/private/tmp/cljs-runtime/...` path and therefore cannot load standalone at
;; all. cloud-itonami's shadow-cljs.edn records that shipping exactly that
;; passed review more than once. The only check that catches it is an actual
;; `import()`.
;;
;; What is asserted here:
;;   - the module loads
;;   - `default.fetch` exists and is callable
;;   - `KaigiRoom` is a constructor whose prototype carries the four method
;;     names the Durable Object runtime calls by name (a munged prototype is
;;     the specific way a ClojureScript-defined DO class fails: the binding
;;     resolves, the object constructs, and every callback silently does not
;;     exist)
;;   - /api/kaigi/health answers, and reports mesh when no SFU is configured
;;   - a bad meeting id is rejected
;;
;; Run: nbb verify-bundle.cljs
