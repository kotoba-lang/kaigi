;; Recording, end to end: real MediaRecorder output reaching real storage, and
;; a consent withdrawal actually stopping it.
;;
;; The assertion that matters is NOT "the UI said recording". It is that bytes
;; landed under the meeting's prefix, and then that they stopped landing once
;; someone withdrew consent. A recorder that keeps running after a withdrawal
;; is the failure this whole design is arranged to prevent, and it is invisible
;; from any screen — the model says off while the microphone stays on.
