;; A real call on the RealtimeKit plane.
;;
;; `e2e-media.cljs` pins `?transport=mesh` and asserts PeerConnections and
;; inbound-rtp counters. None of that vocabulary exists here: the SDK owns
;; transport, so `window.kaigi.peerIds()` is empty on this plane and a run that
;; looked for it would report a broken call that is working perfectly.
;;
;; What is asserted instead:
;;   1. the room actually negotiated `:realtimekit` (not a silent mesh
;;      fallback, which would make every check below pass for the wrong reason)
;;   2. the SDK reports a joined room that can see the other participant
;;   3. a REMOTE `<video>` is painting frames — `videoWidth > 0` on an element
;;      whose id is not our own. A joined room with no picture is exactly the
;;      failure this plane was wired to fix.
;;
;; Needs a deployment with real RealtimeKit credentials; there is no local
;; equivalent, because the plane is the service.
