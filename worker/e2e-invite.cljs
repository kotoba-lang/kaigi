;; The claim this file exists to test: **you can share a URL and people join.**
;;
;; `e2e.cljs` proves the room relays frames and `e2e-media.cljs` proves media
;; actually flows, but both address a meeting whose id the harness invented.
;; Neither would notice if there were no way for a person to *get* an id — and
;; for most of this repo's life there was not: a bare visit joined a room
;; literally called `lobby`, together with every other bare visitor.
;;
;; So what is asserted here is the path a person takes: open the site, press
;; one button, send the link, and have the person who opens it end up in the
;; same call under a name they typed rather than a random per-tab id.
