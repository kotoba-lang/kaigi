;; A real call: two browsers, real PeerConnections, real RTP.
;;
;; `e2e.cljs` proves the signaling plane — two sockets, one roster, frames
;; delivered to the right peer. It cannot prove a call happened, because a
;; connection can report `connected` while carrying no media at all (a peer
;; that answered before its local tracks existed negotiates a silent session
;; and looks healthy). So the assertion that matters here is **bytesReceived
;; from an inbound-rtp stat is greater than zero on both sides**. Everything
;; else — participant counts, tiles, connection state — is necessary and
;; insufficient.
;;
;; Chromium is launched with fake media devices, so there is a deterministic
;; test pattern and tone to measure instead of whatever camera the machine has:
;;   --use-fake-device-for-media-stream  synthesizes camera/mic
;;   --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream      auto-grants permission
;; `chromium.executablePath()` is passed explicitly rather than relying on
;; launch()'s default, following the finding baked into
;; wasm-webcomponent/test/render/lib/webgpu-harness.
;;
;; Two separate browser instances, not two pages in one: pages in one browser
;; share a media-device backend, and a bug that only appears across processes
;; would be invisible.
;;
;; Run (against a dev server or the deployment):
;;   npx wrangler dev --port 8799 --local &
;;   nbb e2e-media.cljs http://127.0.0.1:8799
