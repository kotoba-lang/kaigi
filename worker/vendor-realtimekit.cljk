;; Why this is not a `:require` in `kaigi.app`
;;
;; The published package's CommonJS entry contains `super()` inside an arrow
;; function, and the Closure compiler refuses to compile that at all. Measured
;; 2026-08-01, `shadow-cljs release app` fails with:
;;
;;   Closure compilation failed with 1 errors
;;   --- node_modules/@cloudflare/realtimekit/dist/index.cjs.js:8
;;   closure-compiler does not allow calls to `super()` in arrow functions
;;
;; The package also ships `dist/browser.js` — a prebuilt IIFE that assigns the
;; client to the global `RealtimeKitClient` and needs no bundler. `kaigi.app`
;; loads it with a `<script>` tag on first use, so a deployment running on the
;; mesh never downloads it.
;;
;; The version is pinned by package.json, so this is a copy and not a
;; download: nothing here reaches the network, and the file that ships is the
;; file `npm ci` resolved.
;;
;; Run (from worker/, after npm install and before wrangler deploy):
