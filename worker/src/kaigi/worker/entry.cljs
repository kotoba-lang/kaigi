(ns kaigi.worker.entry
  "Worker entry: the `KaigiRoom` Durable Object class and the default fetch
  handler, both defined in ClojureScript.

  ## Why the class is a `deftype`

  A Durable Object binding needs a real exported class whose prototype carries
  `fetch`, `webSocketMessage`, `webSocketClose` and `webSocketError` under
  exactly those names, and whose constructor takes `(ctx, env)` positionally.
  ClojureScript's `deftype` emits precisely that: positional constructor
  fields and `Object` protocol methods written to the prototype un-munged. So
  the class needs no JavaScript shim — which matters here because CLAUDE.md
  forbids new hand-written `.mjs`, and a shim is where the logic would start
  leaking back into JS.

  The methods hold no logic of their own; they delegate to
  `kaigi.worker.room`, which is where the decisions are and where the state
  registry lives.

  ## Build

      npx shadow-cljs release worker

  `release`, never `compile` — a `compile` build exits 0 and emits every
  expected export name while importing a machine-local `/tmp/cljs-runtime`
  path that cannot load standalone at all. cloud-itonami's `:edge-api`
  comment records that this passed review more than once. Verify with
  `nbb verify-bundle.cljs`, which actually `import()`s the artifact."

  is the one operational question whose wrong answer is invisible: a
  deployment missing `REALTIME_APP_ID` still works, in mesh, until the fifth
  participant joins and the uplinks give out.

  Always returns a Promise, even for the routes that could answer
  synchronously. The Workers runtime accepts either, but a function that
  returns a bare Response on one path and a Promise on another cannot be
  driven uniformly by a caller — including the bundle verifier, which is the
  first caller that tripped over it."
