  "KaigiRoom — the Durable Object that serializes one meeting.

  A meeting needs exactly one writer. Two participants admitting the same
  knock, or two joins racing to publish a track, produce a roster that
  disagrees with itself; and every fix for that from the outside is a lease,
  a fencing token, or a compare-and-swap loop. A Durable Object is globally
  unique and single-threaded per id, so `one writer` is a property of where
  the code runs rather than something this file has to implement. That is the
  use CLAUDE.md sanctions: **DO as serializer and realtime room, D1 for
  storage.**

  Accordingly the authoritative *live* meeting value lives here (in memory,
  rehydrated from DO storage on wake), and anything that has to be queryable
  across meetings goes to D1 through `kaigi.worker.journal`. Putting the
  cross-meeting plane in DO storage would give one private SQLite per room —
  as many islands as there are meetings, and no way to ask a question that
  spans them.

  ## Hibernation

  Sockets are accepted with `ctx.acceptWebSocket`, so the room survives
  isolate eviction without staying warm. The participant id is carried in the
  socket's serialized attachment rather than an in-memory map, because that
  map does not survive the eviction the hibernation API exists to allow.

  ## Wire format is EDN, not JSON

  Both ends of this socket are ClojureScript, and the meeting model is
  EDN-native: `:kaigi.recording/consents` is a set, `:webrtc.room/tracks` is a
  set, admission and roles are keywords. JSON round-trips none of those
  faithfully — a set becomes an array and comes back a vector, a keyword
  becomes a string — so every message would need a translation layer whose
  only job is undoing the format. `cljs.reader/read-string` reads data only
  (no evaluation), which is what makes this safe on untrusted input."
