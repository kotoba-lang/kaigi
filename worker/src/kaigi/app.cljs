  "The browser half: real media over a real PeerConnection.

  Responsibilities, and nothing else:
  1. hold the WebSocket to the room and speak the EDN frame protocol,
  2. capture local media and keep one `RTCPeerConnection` per peer that
     `kaigi.plan` says to hold,
  3. re-render `kaigi.ui/console` from each new roster and swap it in,
  4. translate `data-act` clicks into control frames.

  Every decision it acts on comes from the pure layer: who to connect to and
  which side offers is `kaigi.plan/mesh-plan`, what a control is allowed to do
  is `kaigi.signal`, and the roster is a `kaigi.model` value. This namespace
  contributes no policy.

  ## Offer direction is taken from the plan, not negotiated

  The room tells each participant whether it is the `:offerer` or the
  `:answerer` for each peer, derived from a total order over participant ids.
  Both sides compute the same answer independently, so there is no
  \"perfect negotiation\" rollback logic here and no state in which both peers
  hold a local offer. That failure — signaling glare — presents as a call that
  never connects, with no error on either side.

  ## Video elements outlive renders

  The console markup is re-rendered on every roster change and swapped in via
  `innerHTML`. A `<video>` inside that subtree would be destroyed and rebuilt,
  losing `srcObject` and restarting playback — so a mute toggle would flicker
  everyone's video. Media elements are therefore created once, kept in
  `video-elements`, and re-parented into the freshly rendered tiles after each
  swap."

  camera permission prompt has even been answered. Connecting then produces an
  offer with no tracks in it at all: `ensure-peer!` finds no local stream, the
  session negotiates zero m-lines, ICE never runs, and both tabs sit at one
  PeerConnection each with nothing flowing.

  Measured 2026-08-01 while building this screen — the end-to-end harness
  clicked 参加 the instant the selector appeared and the run reported a
  two-person roster, one peer per side, no ICE and zero RTP. A person on a
