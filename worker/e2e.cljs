;; End-to-end test of a real room: two WebSocket clients against a running
;; kaigi Worker, exercising the Durable Object for real.
;;
;; This is the test the unit suite cannot be: `kaigi.signal/route` is proven
;; pure and correct in isolation, but nothing in that suite shows that a second
;; client actually receives the first one's SDP — which requires the DO to have
;; serialized two sockets, kept one roster across them, and delivered to the
;; right one. Every bug in the glue between the pure core and the runtime lives
;; here.
;;
;; Node 22+ ships a global WebSocket, so there is no client dependency.
;;
;; Run against a local dev server:
;;   npx wrangler dev --port 8799 --local &
;;   nbb e2e.cljs ws://127.0.0.1:8799
;; or against the deployment:
;;   nbb e2e.cljs wss://kaigi.<subdomain>.workers.dev
;;
;; Written as a flat list of steps rather than a nested promise tree: the
;; nested version was written first and had a paren mismatch that took longer
;; to find than the whole rewrite.
