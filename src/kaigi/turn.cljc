  "ICE server configuration, including ephemeral TURN credentials.

  ## Why credentials are minted per participant and not configured

  A TURN server needs to authenticate its clients, and the obvious way — put a
  username and password in the Worker's environment and hand the same pair to
  every browser — publishes a permanent relay credential to anyone who opens
  devtools. Whoever finds it can relay arbitrary traffic through the server for
  as long as nobody rotates it, and nothing in the meeting will look wrong.

  So this namespace mints the coturn `use-auth-secret` form instead (the
  de-facto WebRTC standard, `kotoba.turn.credential`):

      username   = \"<expiry-unix-seconds>:<participant-id>\"
      credential = base64(HMAC-SHA1(shared-secret, username))

  The shared secret never leaves the server; each browser receives a credential
  that expires, is bound to one participant id, and is useless to anyone else.
  `org-ietf-turn` verifies exactly this form, so the relay needs no user
  database.

  ## Why TURN's absence is returned as data

  Without a relay, participants behind symmetric NAT or a corporate firewall
  fail to connect — and the failure looks identical to a hung connection.
  `turn-configured?` lets the console say so on screen instead of leaving
  someone watching a spinner. That distinction is the whole reason this returns
  a value rather than logging.

  Pure: `now` and the secret are supplied by the caller. No clock, no I/O."

  authenticates when the allocation is created, and a long call keeps using the
  allocation it already has."
