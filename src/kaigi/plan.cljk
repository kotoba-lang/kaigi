  "Who subscribes to whom — the media-topology decision, as pure functions.

  Given a meeting value, this namespace answers: which remote tracks should
  each participant be receiving right now, and what operations move them from
  what they have to what they should have. The host executes the returned
  operations; it does not decide them.

  ## Two transports, one decision function

  `transport` picks the best plane the deployment is *provisioned* for and
  every connected client can actually *drive*. The choice is a function of
  configuration and client capability, not of participant count, so a
  deployment behaves the same on every join instead of switching topology
  mid-meeting and having to renegotiate everything.

  The mesh path exists because it needs no external credential and works
  today; it is honest about its ceiling (`mesh-viable?`). The SFU path is the
  one that scales, because each participant then uploads once regardless of
  how many people are watching.

  ## Why the client gets a vote

  Configuration alone decided this once, and the failure it produced is the
  reason it no longer does. `REALTIMEKIT_*` secrets were set on the live
  Worker while the browser bundle could still only drive the mesh; `transport`
  duly reported `:realtimekit`, the client's plan applier no-opped on
  everything that was not `:mesh`, and the deployment carried **no media at
  all** — a full roster, working controls, mute propagating between tabs, and
  zero PeerConnections. Measured 2026-08-01: 0 inbound RTP bytes on both
  sides, with nothing in any log naming the cause.

  A plane nobody in the room can drive is not a plane. So a client declares
  what it can drive in its `hello`, `negotiate` intersects those declarations
  with what is configured, and a deployment that gets ahead of its own bundle
  degrades to a working mesh instead of to silence.

  This does mean the plane can change when a client with a stale bundle joins.
  That is a different thing from switching on headcount, which is what the
  \"configuration, not headcount\" rule forbids: headcount changes constantly
  and tells you nothing about what will work, whereas a participant who
  literally cannot drive the current plane is a meeting that is about to be
  silent for them. Everyone moving together to a plane everyone can drive is
  the only outcome in which the call still happens.

  ## Diffs, not rebuilds

  `pull-diff` returns only what changed. Re-subscribing to tracks a
  participant already has would renegotiate the PeerConnection on every
  roster change, which is visible as a video freeze for everyone — so the
  plan is always expressed as `pull these, close those`."

  "Above this many participants a full mesh stops being reasonable: each
  participant uploads its own media once per peer, so upload scales with
  n-1. Four is where a typical consumer uplink is still comfortable at
  ordinary webcam bitrates.

  This is a stated limit, not an enforced one — `mesh-viable?` reports it and
  the host decides what to do. Silently degrading quality would be worse
  than saying the meeting outgrew the transport."

  layers — RealtimeKit is built on the SFU, so running against both at once
  would mean two systems allocating tracks for the same participants — and a
  deployment that somehow carried both should behave predictably rather than
  by accident of check order."
