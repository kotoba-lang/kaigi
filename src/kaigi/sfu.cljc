  "Cloudflare Realtime SFU binding — request shaping and response parsing as
  pure functions. No HTTP client, no `fetch`, no secrets.

  ## Why this is a data layer and not a client

  The SFU protocol is the part of a meeting that is hardest to test and
  easiest to get subtly wrong: a misspelled `trackName`, a `location` of
  `\"remote\"` where `\"local\"` belongs, a missing `sessionId` on a pull. All
  of those are decisions, and decisions belong in portable code with tests.
  Sending bytes is mechanism, and it stays in the host (`kaigi.worker.room`).

  Every function here returns a request descriptor:

      {:kaigi.sfu/method :post | :put | :get
       :kaigi.sfu/url    \"https://rtc.live.cloudflare.com/v1/apps/…\"
       :kaigi.sfu/body   {…}}   ; absent for GET

  Body maps use keyword keys spelled EXACTLY as the wire field names
  (`:sessionDescription`, `:trackName`, `:requiresImmediateRenegotiation`),
  because the JSON is camelCase and a translation table between two spellings
  is one more thing to drift. A ClojureScript host serializes with
  `clj->js` + `JSON.stringify` and gets the right document; a JVM host with
  any keyword-to-string JSON writer does too.

  ## The token is not in the request

  `request` descriptors deliberately carry no `Authorization` header, so a
  descriptor can be logged, diffed and asserted on without leaking the app
  secret. `authorize` is the single function that attaches it, called by the
  host immediately before the send.

  ## Field names are from the published spec, not from memory

  Shapes follow Cloudflare's OpenAPI document `realtime-api-2024-05-21.yaml`
  (`servers: https://rtc.live.cloudflare.com/v1`, bearer auth). The endpoints
  used here are `POST /apps/{appId}/sessions/new`,
  `POST /apps/{appId}/sessions/{sessionId}/tracks/new`,
  `PUT  /apps/{appId}/sessions/{sessionId}/renegotiate`,
  `PUT  /apps/{appId}/sessions/{sessionId}/tracks/close` and
  `GET  /apps/{appId}/sessions/{sessionId}`."
