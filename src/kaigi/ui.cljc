(ns kaigi.ui
  "The meeting console as pure `.cljc` hiccup.

  Takes plain data — a `kaigi.model` meeting value and the local participant's
  id — and returns hiccup. Nothing here touches the DOM, a clock, or
  `getUserMedia`, so the same fn renders server-side via `kotoba-ui.core/->page`
  and in the browser from `kaigi.app`, which re-invokes it with each new roster
  and swaps the result in. That is the dual-render contract, and it is why the
  markup is not written twice (once as hiccup and once as JS template strings,
  which then drift).

  ## Video elements are deliberately NOT rendered here

  `participant-tile` emits an empty container carrying
  `data-kaigi-participant`. `kaigi.app` creates one `<video>` per participant
  and moves it into that container, and never re-creates it.

  This split is not incidental. A `<video>` whose element is replaced loses its
  `srcObject` and restarts playback — so a roster update as small as someone
  toggling their microphone would make everyone's video flicker. Keeping media
  elements out of the re-rendered tree makes that impossible rather than
  merely avoided.

  ## Design system

  `kotoba-ui.core` + `appkit.core` only (agent-guide rule 1). No raw hex, no
  px font-size, no font-family (rule 2) — every value is a `--hig-*` token or
  an HIG text style. Layout from `kotoba-ui.shell` (rule 4). Interaction is
  expressed as `data-act` values that `kaigi.app` dispatches on, so no
  handlers are baked into the hiccup and the SSR and browser output are
  identical for identical data."
