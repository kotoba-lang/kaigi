  "Cloudflare RealtimeKit binding — request shaping and response parsing as
  pure functions. No HTTP client, no secrets.

  ## RealtimeKit is the media plane, not the meeting

  RealtimeKit has its own notion of a meeting and a participant, and adopting
  it wholesale would put two authorities in the same system: its presets would
  decide who may speak while `kaigi.model` decides who is admitted, and the two
  would disagree the first time a host denied someone.

  So the split is explicit. `kaigi.model` stays the authority for admission,
  roles and recording consent; RealtimeKit carries audio and video. The seam is
  `participant-request`, which the room may only call for a participant
  `kaigi.model` says is `:admitted` — see `token-refusal`. RealtimeKit never
  learns about the lobby, and it does not need to: someone who is not admitted
  simply never receives a token, and a meeting they cannot get a token for is
  one they cannot join.

  ## This is a different product from the SFU, with different credentials

  `kaigi.sfu` talks to `rtc.live.cloudflare.com/v1/apps/{appId}/…` with an app
  secret. This talks to the Cloudflare API at
  `/accounts/{account}/realtime/kit/{app}/…` with a **Cloudflare API token**.
  An SFU app id is not a RealtimeKit app id — measured 2026-07-31, a
  RealtimeKit app id returns exactly the same `not_found` from the SFU API as
  an all-zeros UUID does. `kaigi.sfu` is kept rather than deleted (the SFU
  remains the lower-level option, and the binding is written and tested), but
  the two are never configured at once; see `kaigi.plan/transport`.

  Portable `.cljc`: no clock, no I/O. Ids and tokens are supplied by the
  caller."
